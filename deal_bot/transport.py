"""Shared HTTP transport with bounded retry/backoff.

Every outbound HTTP call in the package routes through `request()`, so
transient failures (network blips, 429/5xx) are retried once, in one place,
instead of each caller re-implementing "try/except + print + return". This
protects dedupe correctness: a transient `load_seen`/`upsert_seen_entry`
failure no longer silently becomes an empty seen-map or a dropped write,
either of which risks a double-post on the next run.

Scope: Supabase storage, the OpenRouter client, run_log, the weekly digest,
the watchdog, and the read-only source GETs (Woot/Best Buy/Shopify). Discord
webhook posts and Bluesky XRPC posts are deliberately OUT of this layer —
they are non-idempotent POSTs whose auto-retry after a lost response would
silently double-post a deal, so each carries its own bounded loop that
retries only explicit rate-limit responses instead.

Retry policy:
- Retries network errors (requests.RequestException) and retryable statuses.
- Retryable statuses: 408, 425, 429, 500, 502, 503, 504.
- Permanent 4xx (400/401/404) are NOT retried — they'd never succeed.
- Honors a Retry-After header on 429 (seconds).
- Returns the last Response; returns None only after exhausting network
  retries (so callers can distinguish "network failure" from "HTTP response").
